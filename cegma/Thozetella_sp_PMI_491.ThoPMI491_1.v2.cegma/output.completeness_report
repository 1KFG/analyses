#    Prots = number of 248 ultra-conserved CEGs present in genome          #
#    %Completeness = percentage of 248 ultra-conserved CEGs present        #
#    Total = total number of CEGs present including putative orthologs     #
#    Average = average number of orthologs per CEG                         #
#    %Ortho = percentage of detected CEGS that have more than 1 ortholog   #
